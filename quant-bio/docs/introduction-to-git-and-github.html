<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Motivation</h2>
<p>As a biology graduate student or a professional biologist in a university or
government setting, why might you want to use Git and GitHub? And what are Git
and GitHub anyway?</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists (including students) are working far more collaboratively than in the past</li>
<li>This involves both sharing code and writing up results</li>
<li>There is a push towards open science – including your code as part of a scientific paper</li>
<li>We have called this a TTT approach:
<ul>
<li>Transparent – a clear and open way to show data, code, and results, enabling reproducibility</li>
<li>Traceable – a clear link from database queries and code to final results (numbers, tables, and graphs in a document)</li>
<li>Transferable – it should be feasible for another person to reproduce work and build upon it with a minimal learning curve</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Using Git and GitHub in your workflow greatly enables this, both when working alone and in a team.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: red;">Git</span> keeps track of the latest versions of your files,
such as computer code or write up for results as you work on them.</li>
<li>It also allows you to go back to <span style="color: red;">any previous version</span> of your
files (this is ‘version control’). (It also does much more).</li>
<li><span style="color: red;">GitHub</span> is a website that hosts a ‘repository’ of your work code and enables
users to easily collaborate.</li>
<li>Your repositories can be either public or private.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use Git and GitHub extensively:</p>
<ul>
<li>to collaborate on writing code and producing documents (such as this entire document!).</li>
<li>to easily share code publically for scientific papers, and update it if necessary.</li>
<li>when working alone to retain a methodical workflow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example application – Pacific Hake stock assessment</strong></p>
<p>Under a formal Agreement between the Canadian and US governments, a team of four
of us (two from each country) conduct an
annual stock assessment for Pacific Hake (<em>Merluccius productus</em>) off the west
coast of Canada and the US. The assessment is used to manage the stock, which is of important
ecological and economic value ($100 million export value in Canada).</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/hake-picture.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>We fit complex population models to data to make projections about future
health of the stock under different levels of catch. There is a very short
turnaround (five weeks) between getting the final data, doing the analyses
(model runs can take many hours of computer time) and submitting the
assessment document, which is typically &gt;200 pages and contains numerous figures
and tables <a href="https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/2021-03/hake-assessment-post-srg-final_20210303.pdf?null">available
here</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to 2016, the document was assembled in Word, requiring lots of editing
and amaglamating of files, often late at night. Now we share our code via
GitHub, automate a lot of the document production using knitr (similar to
Rmarkdown, covered in Module 2).</p>
<p>So with four people constantly working on the same large document, we need to
ensure we are keeping up-to-date with each other, can all produce the latest
version, and have <span style="color: red;">identical</span> folder structures on each other’s
computers. The alternative of emailing files back and forth is:</p>
<ul>
<li>very inefficient,</li>
<li>prone to errors,</li>
<li>just painful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we can avoid</strong></p>
<p>Using GitHub it is easy to see what text/code collaborators have changed, avoiding
things like the following, for which it hard to see where to get started:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/interim.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>We may want to keep old versions of files (and email them back and forth), but
without GitHub we can end up with a veritable gong show:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/EAversions.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>We can avoid having to co-ordinate having only one person working on the latest
version of a document, so we don’t get things like:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/proposalEmail.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Can avoid multiple versions of a file that then have to be carefully merged:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/dogsBreakfast.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>While GoogleDocs, for example, is fine for collaborating on a short document, it
isn’t suitable for sharing complex code, or complex documents that are somewhat
automatically updated.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub advantages</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Say you’ve off on a two-week hike while your collaborators
have been diligently working away and they have edited 15 new files of code in
five folders, added four data sets, and created five new pages of text towards
a manuscript. You can easily
catch up with them (get all their changes onto your computer) with a few
simple commands. You don’t even have to pester them to ask what they’ve done,
as you can check it yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>So rather than this conversation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You: “Hey, I’m back from my awesome trip and saw some bears. What have you
been doing with the project?”</p></li>
<li><p>Likely reply: “Glad you had fun. I’m busy on something else right now. Er,
where were we at when you left?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can have this one:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You: “Hey, I’m back from my awesome trip and saw some bears. I went through your
commits on GitHub and everything looks great. Shall I get on those Methods
Issues you assigned me?”</p></li>
<li><p>Likely reply: “Glad you had fun, looking forward to hearing about it. I’m busy
on something else right now so, yes, resolving those issues will be great,
thanks.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And the project keeps moving in an efficient way.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>By having code shared publically, it is easy to answer questions, such as
this one I received:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/MEEcodeQuest.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Rather than go searching on my laptop for the code that I hadn’t looked at for
six months, I could click on the link the questioner sent and answer very
quickly, with a simple link to the file I am referring to (there is no ambiguity):</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/MEEcodeAnswer.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can even ask who last edited a particular line of code/text (GitHub
amusingly calls it ‘Blame’):</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/blame.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You can properly keep track of (and discuss) ‘Issues’ to be thought about or
fixed, rather than having things in emails that get forgotten:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/hakeIssues21.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Important:</strong> You still have all your work locally on your computer. So if
your internet access goes down or GitHub is unavailable (which of course will only happen
when you have a deadline) you can still carry on with your work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why this course?</strong></p>
<p>Delving into the Git and GitHub world online it can feel like you need a
computer science degree to get started. This may not be surprising as Git
was writting by the guy who wrote the operating system Linux, to help people
collaborate on writing the operating system Linux. But it means that, for
example, the second paragraph of the Wikipedia Git page says:</p>
<p>“As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most
client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged
repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities,
independent of network access or a central server.”</p>
<p>Say what??? That is fairly incomprehensible to those without strong computer science
backgrounds. The aim of this module is to introduce biologists to the world of
Git and GitHub, while avoiding a lot of the technical details. However, once you
have mastered the basics then it should be easier to delve deeper.</p>
<p>Our target audience is:</p>
<ul>
<li>graduate level biology students</li>
<li>biology faculty</li>
<li>government scientists</li>
<li>scientists in non-governmental organisations</li>
<li>in fact anyone wanting to learn these tools</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is extended from lectures and exercises developed by Chris Grandin and
myself as part of a
<a href="https://github.com/pbs-assess/TTTworkshop">Fisheries and Oceans Canada workshop</a>. (Luckily Chris
<em>does</em> have a computer science degree, and so was able to get some of us going
with Git and GitHub several years ago). These tools are now widely used within
our organisation.</p>
<p><strong>Computer language</strong></p>
<p>For sharing code, it doesn’t matter what language your code is in (R, Matlab, Python, C,
…), as we will just be sharing text files. There is a learning curve, but once
you get going you only really need a few main commands. Unfortunately the hardest bit is
actually getting everything set up….</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-set-up-for-the-first-time" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Getting set up for the first time</h2>
<p>Before you start using Git you need to set up your computer to use it, and install a few other programs that are useful.</p>
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">one-time setup</span>
and once it is done, you
will be able to easily create new projects or join others in collaboration.</p>
<p>We have tested the installations as much as feasible. If you have an issue then search the internet, as it may be due to some configuration on your particular computer.</p>
<p>This module is for any operating system: Windows, MacOS, Linux or Unix.</p>
<div id="what-you-will-end-up-having-installed" class="section level3" number="4.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> What you will end up having installed</h3>
<p>These are programs/things you will need (instructions are on the next slides). Obviously skip any that you already have working.</p>
<ul>
<li>A GitHub account</li>
<li>A text editor that isn’t Notepad</li>
<li>Git on your computer</li>
<li>Diffmerge or something similar for comparing changes to files (not completely necessary)</li>
<li>Markdown Pad 2 or Chrome extension or something similar for viewing Markdown files (not completely necessary)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="get-a-github-account" class="section level3" number="4.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Get a GitHub account</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for GitHub: <a href="http://github.com" class="uri">http://github.com</a></li>
<li>If possible, choose a user name that will make sense to colleagues, e.g. <strong>andrew-edwards</strong> or <strong>cgrandin</strong>, not <strong>pink-unicorn</strong>.</li>
<li>Desirable: attach a photo (headshot) to your profile. This makes it easy for collaborators to identify you.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="text-editor" class="section level3" number="4.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Text Editor</h3>
<p>You must have a text editor that is aware of outside changes in a file. This is necessary because if you have a file open in the editor and you download an updated version of the file, you want the editor to ask you if you want to use the updated version.</p>
<p>We know that <strong>Emacs</strong>, <strong>Xemacs</strong> and maybe <strong>Vim</strong> are okay, as is <strong>RStudiofor.R</strong> (and other) files.</p>
<p><strong>Notepad</strong> is not okay. But you can download and install <strong>Notepad++</strong> which is fine:</p>
<p><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.3.3.html" class="uri">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.3.3.html</a></p>

<div id="install-the-git-application-on-your-machine" class="section level3" number="4.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Install the Git application on your machine</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> for downloading instructions for Windows, MAC and Linux/Unix</p>
<p>It seems best to accept the default options, except NOT Notepad or Vim (unless
you use Vim) as the default editor.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-shell" class="section level3" number="4.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Git shell</h3>
<p>For this course we will use a simple git shell to type commands (rather than a point-and-click Graphical User Interface). This is for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Commands are the same across operating systems.</li>
<li>It is easier to demonstrate (and remember) a few simple commands, rather than follow a cursor moving across a screen.</li>
<li>Learning the text commands will give you a good understanding of how Git and GitHub work.</li>
<li>It is easier to Google for help when you get stuck or want to learn about more advanced options.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="git-shell-rstudio" class="section level3" number="4.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.6</span> Git shell, RStudio</h3>
<p>There are many Graphical User Interfaces that are available, as described at <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis</a>.</p>
<p>Many (but not all) biologists use R in RStudio for their analyses. There is Git functionality built in to RStudio that we (TODO: SOMEONE?) will demonstrate later.</p>
<p>I use magit which works in the text editor emacs (which for years I have used
for pretty much everything, such as editing files, running R, Matlab, etc.). But
I would not have been able to learn magit without first knowing the Git commands
from using the shell.</p>
<p>For now we will stick with the Git shell for the aforementioned reasons. It will
also give you a better understanding of Git and GitHub, and emphasise that you
can use Git for any files, not just R code.</p>
</div>
<div id="powershell-and-posh-git" class="section level3" number="4.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.7</span> Powershell and posh-git</h3>
<p>Download a Powershell (a shell window in which you can type commands, presumably
the ‘power’ part means it’s more powerful than a basic version) and then
posh-git following the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git" class="uri">https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git</a></p>
<p>Do the ‘Installation’ and ‘Using posh-git’ sections. If you don’t understand
some options (I don’t!) just pick the simplest, usually the first.</p>
<p>The next slides are from our course about three years ago (and were for
Windows). So they may be out of date (though first one is recent tips from a colleague).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Using Git and GitHub</h2>
<p>This section also has a recorded lecture to
demonstrate the main concepts and ideas. The lecture is available here (TODO)
and the slides from the talk are here (TODO), though the notes below mostly
replicate the slides.</p>
<div id="definitions" class="section level3" number="4.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Definitions</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repository – essentially a directory containing all your files for a
project (plus some files that Git uses).</li>
<li>Git – a program that allows you to efficiently save ongoing versions of
your files (`version control’).</li>
<li>GitHub – a website that hosts your repositories so that you can easily
share code and collaborate with colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the idea is that you work on your files in a repository on your computer, use Git on
your computer when you are happy to keep your changes, and use GitHub to easily
share the files.</p>
<p>Here you will learn the important steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating – create a new repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Cloning – copying it to your local computer</li>
<li>Committing – the crux of working with Git</li>
<li>Collaborating – efficiently work with colleagues</li>
<li>Conflicts – fixing conflict changes (happens rarely)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-new-repository" class="section level3" number="4.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Creating a new repository</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sign into your GitHub account, click on the <em>Repositories</em> tab, and press the <em>New</em> button.</li>
<li>Give your repository a name. Let’s call it test.</li>
<li>Check <em>Initialize</em> this <em>repository</em> with a <em>README</em>.</li>
<li>Leave <em>Add .gitignore</em> and <em>Add a license</em> set to <em>None</em></li>
<li>Click <em>Create repository</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You now have a new repository on the GitHub website. Next we will clone it onto your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="cloning-your-new-repository" class="section level3" number="4.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Cloning your new repository</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy the full URL (web address) of your test repository.</li>
<li>Open the Git shell and navigate to your <em>C://github</em> directory (or whatever you called it when you created it in the setup instructions – it’s the place you are going to save all your Git repositories).</li>
<li>Run the following command to <em>clone</em> your repository:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git clone URL</code></p>
<p>where URL is the url of your newly created repository (paste should work).</p>
<p>You should now have a subdirectory called <em>github/test</em> on your computer.
In Git shell, change to that directory (with <code>cd test</code>).</p>
<p>So ‘clone’ is Git speak for copying something from GitHub onto your local
computer. This example has just one file (<em>README.md</em>). But the process is the
same for a repository with multiple files and multiple directories, and the
complate file sturcture is fully preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Windows only: Storing your credentials</strong></p>
<p>When you are using the Git shell for the very first time on Windows, issue the following command:</p>
<p><code>git config --global credential.helper wincred</code></p>
<p>This means that you don’t have to repeatedly enter you GitHub password (just do it when you are first prompted).</p>
</div>
<div id="committing" class="section level3" number="4.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Committing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a new file, <em>newFile.txt</em>, in the <em>github/test</em> directory.</li>
<li>Add a line of text at the start of the file and save it.</li>
<li>Check the status of your (test) repository:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git status</code></p>
<ul>
<li>It should say that you have an ‘Untracked file’ called <em>newFile.txt</em>. You want
to tell Git to start tracking it, by using:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git add. gitignore</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <code>git status</code> again.</li>
<li>You should see that the file is listed as a ‘new file’ under ‘Changes to be commited.’</li>
<li>Let’s now ‘commit’ it:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git commit -a -m "Add newFile.txt."</code></p>
<p>The commit message (in the quotes) should be a useful message saying what the
commit encapsulates (more on that later).</p>
<ul>
<li>Push the commit to GitHub:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git push</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Check (refresh) the GitHub webpage and see your commit and the uploaded file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What just happened?</strong></p>
<p>We just used three of the main Git commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code> – tell Git to start keeping track of changes to this file. You only need to tell Git this once.</li>
<li><code>git commit -a -m "Message."</code> – committing your changes, which means tell Git you are happy with your edits and want to save them.</li>
<li><code>git push</code> – this sends your commit to the GitHub website.</li>
</ul>
<p>You always have your files stored locally on your computer (as usual), even if you don’t add them or commit changes.</p>
<p>When you push to GitHub then your colleagues can easily fetch (retrieve) them.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard aliases (shortcuts)</strong></p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p><code>git commit -a -m "Message."</code></p>
<p>is a bit much to type, so we have an alias for it:</p>
<p><code>git com "Message."</code></p>
<p>This is defined in the <em>.gitconfig</em> file you installed in the <code>git-setup</code>
instructions into <code>C:\Users\YOUR-USER-NAME\.gitconfig</code> (for Windows). YOu can
also add your own commands to that file.</p>
<p>The <code>-a</code> means ‘commit all changes of files that Git is tracking,’ and <code>-m</code> is
to include a message. Since we usually want to do both of these,
<code>git com "Message."</code> is a useful shortcut. But it is important to realise it is an alias if searching online for help.</p>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<p><code>git s</code> – for <code>git status</code></p>
<p><code>git p</code> – for <code>git push</code></p>
<p><code>git d</code> – for <code>git diff</code></p>
<p><code>git f</code> – for <code>git fetch</code></p>
<p>From now on we will mostly use the aliases. Use the full commands if the
<em>.gitconfig</em> file didn’t work for you.</p>
<p><strong>Edit <em>Readme.md</em></strong></p>
<p>Edit the <em>Readme.md</em> file. Add some simple comments describing the project such as: “A test repository for learning Git.”</p>
<p>Look over the changes, commit them, and push them to your GitHub repository:</p>
<p><code>git s</code></p>
<p><code>git d</code> (or <code>git diff</code>) – this gives a simple look at the differences between the last committed version and your current version (of all files; only one in this case)</p>
<p><code>git com</code> “Initial edit of Readme.md”</p>
<p><code>git p</code> (or <code>git push</code>)</p>
<p>Refresh your GitHub web page and you should see your text (the <em>Readme.md</em> file is what is shown on the main page of your repo).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> Exercise 1: create, edit and commit <em>simpleText.txt</em></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a text file <em>simpleText.txt</em> in your local <code>test</code> repository. Add a

<li>Add the file to the repository using the git commands:</li>

<li>Keep and eye on your commits by refreshing the GitHub page.</li>
</ol>
<p>In reality when writing code/text you won’t be committing quite so frequently,
as your focus will be on the writing.</p>
<p><strong>Adding multiple files at once</strong></p>
<p>Often you add multiple files in a new directory. When you run <code>git s</code>, you will
see a large list of <em>Untracked files</em>. They can be all added at once by simply
adding the whole directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise-2-multiple-files" class="section level3" number="4.3.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.6</span> Exercise 2: multiple files</h3>
<p>Do the following, to get the idea of creating multiple files in a folder and
committing that folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new directory in your <code>test</code> repository, using your normal method. Call it <em>new-stuff</em>.</li>
<li>Add a few new test files to that directory called <em>test1.txt</em>, <em>test2.txt</em>,
etc. Put some example text in one or more of them if you want.</li>
<li>On the command line, check the status:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git s</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You will see a listing showing the <em>new-stuff/</em> directory in <em>Untracked files</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>To add all the new files in preparation for a commit, issue the command:
<code>git add new-stuff/</code></p></li>
<li><p>Check the status of the repository again with <code>git s</code></p></li>
<li><p>It will now show all files in <em>Changes to be committed</em></p></li>
<li><p>Commit the changes:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>git com "Added new-stuff directory."</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Push the changes to GitHub:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git p</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Check your GitHub webpage and see your commit and that the files have been uploaded.</li>
<li>That works no matter how many files are in your new-stuff directory. There
could be a hundred and it’s the same command.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wildcard symbol <code>*</code></strong></p>
<p>This is useful to know (no need to do it as part of the exercise):</p>
<ul>
<li>To add multiple files with similar names you can use the wildcard <code>*</code> symbol.</li>
<li>You just added (told Git to keep track of) the new files in your <em>new-stuff/</em> directory.</li>
<li>If you add more new files to that directory, you will have to tell Git to
track those also. This is because they are new – you haven’t told Git about them yet.</li>
<li>Say you have 10 new files called <em>idea1.txt</em>, <em>idea2.txt</em>, …, <em>idea 10.txt</em>.</li>
<li>Instead of typing</li>
</ul>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/idea1.txt</code></p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/idea2.txt</code></p>
<p>etc. you can just use the wildcard <code>*</code>:</p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/idea*.txt</code></p>
<p>or even just</p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/*.txt</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>git add new-stuff/*.*</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>.gitignore</em> file</strong></p>
<p>But what if you don’t want to add all the files that you create?</p>
<p>Each repository can have a <em>.gitignore</em> file, in the root directory of the repository.
Such a file has names of files (such as <em>my-secret-notes.txt</em>) or wildcard names
(such as _*.pdf_ or _*.doc_ ) that will be completely ignored by Git.</p>
<p>For an example, see
<a href="https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment/blob/master/.gitignore">https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment/blob/master/.gitignore</a>,
noting that the <code>#</code> can be used for comments.</p>
<p>When sharing a repository with others, you want to share your <em>code</em> (for
example, R, Python or Matlab code) and maybe data, but generally <em>not</em> share the
output (such as figures that the code generates; more on this later). For
reproducible research your colleague (or anyone) should be able to run your code
to generate the results.</p>
<p>Some programs you run may make temporary files that don’t need to be tracked by
Git, the names of which should also be included in your <em>.gitignore</em>.</p>
<p>When sharing code or collaborating you want to keep your repository as clean as
possible and not clutter it up with files that other people don’t need.</p>
<p>So when you run <code>git s</code> and see untracked files that you don’t want to be
tracked, add them (or a suitable wildcard expression) to your <em>.gitignore</em> file
so that they are not added inadvertently.</p>
<p>This will also simplify your workflow (you don’t need to keep being reminded
that you have untracked files).</p>
<p>If you are on MacOS and you find that folders have a <em>.DS_Store</em> file in them,
then create (and <code>add</code> and <code>commit</code>) a <em>.gitignore</em> file with <em>.DS_Store</em> as a
line.</p>
<p><strong>Git Workflow</strong></p>
<p>You have now learnt the basics of using Git. By creating a public repository on
GitHub you can now release your code to the world!</p>
<p>You can also choose the <em>private repository</em> option when creating a repository,
so that you can control who can see it. Go into <code>Settings--Manage Access</code> to add
collaborators.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaborating" class="section level3" number="4.3.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7</span> Collaborating</h3>
<p>Now we will show how to collaborate with colleagues, which is where the
usefulness of Git will become more apparent.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to collaborate using Git and GitHub. We will
focus on the following one since it is the simplest, and is what you need to
collaborate with colleagues.</p>
<p>Concept: there is a project where people contribute to a main repository that is
considered the ‘master copy.’</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone clones directly from the creator’s repository.</li>
<li>All collaborators push their commits to the main repository (the creator has
to add them as collaborators once on GitHub).</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the creator has to grant permission, you won’t have just anyone
contributing to (and maybe messing up your work), just your trusted collaborators.</p>
<p>But you have to trust your team to not mess things up (more on that later!).</p>
<p>Okay, so in the video we demonstrated the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kim creates new repo called <code>collaborate</code> (and clones it to her computer).</p></li>
<li><p>Andy clones it also.</p></li>
<li><p>On GitHub, Kim gives Andy ‘push access’ to her <code>collaborate</code> repo.</p></li>
<li><p>Both do some edits (create some new simple text files).</p></li>
<li><p>For Andy to get Kim’s updates (and vice versa), it was just:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git fetch</code> (or just <code>git f</code>) – fetches the latest version of the repository from GitHub onto your computer. Your local files have <em>not</em> yet changed (check them), but Git has the changes stored on your computer (?!?).</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code> – updates your local repository (the committed files on your computer) with the changes you have just fetched, merging both people’s work together.</li>
<li><code>git p</code> – pushes the merged changes back up to GitHub so that the other person can get them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>That is the basic workflow.</p>
<p>We also showed an example of <code>git p</code> <em>not</em> being allowed for Person A because
there are recent commits on GitHub (by Person B) that Person A has not yet
merged into their local version of the repository.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the error message you get:
<img src="../module-1-git/images/unable-to-pull.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>While a bit lengthy, the error message is useful. It forces you to get the other
person’s work before you push yours. You do this by:</p>
<p><code>git f</code>
<code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<p>So to be allowed to push, just <code>fetch</code> to get the new commits onto your computer,
and then <code>rebase</code> to combine the commits into your local version. Then you can</p>
<p><code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a full screenshot (‘g’ is just a shortcut for ‘git’). The green up arrow
number 8 tells me I have 8 commits to push to GitHub. The yellow arrows I think
of as just implying I need to do a rebase (before doing that I might browse
through the other person’s commits on GitHub):
<img src="../module-1-git/images/fix-the-pull.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>After the <code>rebase</code> I was allowed to <code>push</code> and then everything is up to date.</p>
<p><strong>A bit more about git rebase</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Andy commits local changes, tries to <code>git push</code> but is told to first <code>git fetch</code> (to get Kim’s changes from GitHub).</li>
<li>Andy does <code>git fetch</code> and then <code>git rebase</code>.</li>
<li>What <code>git rebase</code> does is basically add Andy’s commits to Kim’s commits. (TODO: check it’s not the othe way around!)</li>
<li>Andy then does <code>git push</code> to push his commits to GitHub (from where Kim will fetch them when she’s ready).</li>
<li>Providing there are no conflicts, this will work fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another option is to do a <code>git merge</code>, which basically creates a new commit that merges both people’s work together.
Our groups used to use <code>git merge</code> and now use <code>git rebase</code>; some people don’t
like <code>git merge</code> because it adds extra commits.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth understanding see <a href="https://reflectoring.io/git-rebase-merge/" class="uri">https://reflectoring.io/git-rebase-merge/</a> for one of the clearer explanations out there concerning rebase v merge.</p>
<p>Note that the error in the above screenshot (when I could not <code>git push</code>) told
me that I might want to do <code>git pull</code>. This is basically</p>
<p><code>git fetch</code></p>
<p><code>git merge</code></p>
<p>in one command, but it seems preferable to do</p>
<p><code>git fetch</code></p>
<p><code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Fixing a conflict</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A <span style="color: red;">conflict</span> happens when two people have edited the <span style="color: red;">same line(s) of the same
file</span>.</li>
<li>Conflicts happen relatively rarely and can be generally avoided by
co-ordinating with collaborators so that you are working on different
files. But, they will happen and you need to know how to resolve them.</li>
<li>Git <em>forces</em> you to explicitly decide whose changes to keep – this is a <span style="color: red;">good</span>
thing, since you want a human to make such a decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the video we demonstrated a conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Fixing a conflict</strong></p>
<p>The best approach I have found to fixing a conflict is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trying <code>git rebase</code> will tell you there is a conflict.</li>
<li><code>git rebase --abort</code> – do this to abort the rebase attempt.</li>
<li><code>git merge</code> – this will tell you there is a conflict.</li>
<li>Open the file(s) with the conflict and edit the text (see below).</li>
<li><code>git add &lt;filename(s)&gt;</code> – you have to then add the files that had the conflict (I am not sure why this is necessary, I just do it).</li>
<li><code>git com "&lt;message&gt;"</code> – in your commit message you can explain how you fixed
the conflict. This is useful so that your collaborators know you have resolved
a conflict (they can look at the commit to see if they are happy with it).</li>
</ul>
<p>The merge message will tell you which files are conflicting. Open those files
one by one, and you will see the conflicted section bracketed like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Line(s) of text/code which are currently in your file.
 =======
Line(s) of text/code which are trying to merge in, but conflict.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; origin/main</code></pre>
<p>where <code>origin/main</code> refers to the version you have fetched from GitHub.
All you do is remove the line(s) of text that you do not want to keep (or edit
the line(s) to be something else entirely), and remove the bracketing lines
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;...</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;...</code>, and the <code>======</code> line.</p>
<p>Save each conflicted file and then (as mentioned previously):</p>
<pre><code>git add &lt;filename(s)&gt;
git com &quot;Kept Kim&#39;s edits as more consistent with remaining text.&quot;
git p</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="exercise-3-collaborating-on-a-single-repository" class="section level3" number="4.3.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.8</span> Exercise 3: collaborating on a single repository</h3>
<p>If you have a colleague available, try what we just did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Person 1 creates a new repository on GitHub and clone to their computer.</li>
<li>Give the Person 2 ‘push access’ to the repository (on the repo page on GitHub: Settings – Manage access – Invite a collaborator)</li>
<li>Person 2 clones to their computer</li>
<li>Both create a simple text file (use different filenames), add some text and, as usual, <code>add</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>push</code>.</li>
<li><code>git fetch</code> and <code>git rebase</code> to get the other person’s file.</li>
<li>Continue editing either file, committing, and pushing.</li>
<li>If you get the push error (shown earlier), refresh GitHub repository site to
see recent commits (click on the XX commits link). You can easily spot the
other person’s recent commits. Click on one (the bold message) to see
details.</li>
<li>Purposefully create a conflict (both edit the same line of the same
file). Resolve it as described earlier.</li>
<li>In practice you won’t commit so frequently when working, but this is good to get the hang of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Congratulations</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations, you now know the few basic commands and functionality needed to collaborate with Git and GitHub.
It takes a bit of practice, but it is very powerful.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">95% of the time, this is all you are doing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Change some code.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>git s
git d
git  com &quot;My commit message&quot;`
git p</code></pre>
<p>(the <code>git s</code> and <code>git d</code> are useful to check you have changed only what you think you have changed).</p>
<p>If GitHub does not allow you to push:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
git rebase</code></pre>
<p>If conflicts, then</p>
<pre><code>git rebase --abort
git merge</code></pre>
<p>fix the conflicts manually and then</p>
<pre><code>git add &lt;conflicted file(s)&gt;
git com &quot;Message to explain what you did&quot;
git p</code></pre>
<p>Change some code and repeat!</p>
<p>The next section gives slightly more advanced background that should further improve
your understanding (including why Git is useful even when not collaborating or
sharing your code), plus tips for improving your workflow.</p>

<div id="beyond-the-basics" class="section level2" number="4.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Beyond the basics</h2>
<p>Here are some Git and GitHub concepts and tips that go beyond the basics that we
just covered.</p>
<div id="workflow-tips" class="section level3" number="4.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Workflow tips</h3>
<p>Realise that you still edit and save your files in the usual way on your
computer. If you don’t do Git commits you will still have the latest versions
of your files on your computer (as you would if you weren’t using Git). So if
you do get stuck with Git you can carry on working as normal (though you
probably do want to try and fix it at some point).</p>
<p>When collaborating:</p>
<ul>
<li>If working closely with others, when you start each day (or after a break)
then make sure you are up to date and have all their commits. Refresh the
GitHub page for you repository, and <code>git fetch</code> (or just <code>git f</code>)and <code>git clone</code> if needed. (To
be safe you can <code>git f</code> and <code>git s</code> to check).</li>
<li>We find it helpful to co-ordinate our work (Slack is useful for this, or use
GitHub Issues for complex discussion – see below), so that if multiple people
are working at the same time, you are at least not working on exactly the same
parts, just to reduce conflicts.</li>
<li>Commit fairly frequently and write helpful commit messages (so your colleagues
get an idea of what you’ve done in each commit). Push less frequently, and
<em>don’t push code that doesn’t work</em> – that will annoy your colleagues. And
then they (and probably you) may both spend time fixing it.</li>
<li>To see who last edited a particular piece of code, when viewing the file on
GitHub click <span style="color: red;">Blame</span> (you can even click on the square icon to
go to the previous commit that changed that line):</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/blame.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p><strong>GitHub Issues</strong></p>
<p>GitHub <em>Issues</em> are very useful for discussing issues with your repo. For our
annual Pacific Hake assessment we have used them extensively over the years:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/hakeIssues21.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>The Issues tab lists our current ‘Open’ issues – we have 20, of which five (the
most recently posted) are
shown here. We are currently in-between assessments (and not working on it), so
we have created Issues that we want to think about or deal with for next
year. This avoids forgetting about ideas or losing them in old emails.</p>
<p>Issues are intuitive to use. There is a bright green ‘New Issues’ button to
create new ones, you give a title and then write some details, people can reply,
you can assign people to look at them, and you can close them. In the above
screenshot you can see that we have closed 815 issues (this was over several years).</p>
<p>Useful tip: when doing a commit that refers to an Issue, if you refer to the
Issue number (with <code>#&lt;number&gt;</code>) in your commit message, then after pushing that commit the Issue on
GitHub will automatically mention and link to the commit:</p>
<p><code>git com "Add more options to fancy_function(), #21."</code></p>
<p>will mention the commit when you look at the issue. You can even automatically
close the issue by saying <code>closes #21</code> in your commit message:</p>
<p><code>git com "Add more options to fancy_function(), closes #21."</code></p>
<p>Issues are particularly useful to avoid cluttering up code with commented notes
or ideas that you may easily not come back to, or avoiding endless emails that
end up getting overlooked. You don’t have to fix an Issue to close it, you can
decide not to pursue, but at least you have made a decision.</p>
<p>(We also use Slack a lot to communicate, but moreso for quick questions or
bouncing ideas around – Issues are better for stuff that you want to come back
to at some point).</p>
<p>You may receive emails regarding Issues, but if you use GitHub a lot you will
see Notifications (the blue dot on the bell in the top-right corner when signed
in on GitHub) and that
will show you new Issues of repositories you are involved with, or if anyone has
updated an Issue.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub organizations</strong></p>
<p>If you will frequently collaborate with colleagues, you can create an
Organization on GitHub and invite collaborators to it (click on your GitHub
photo in the top-right corner, Settings, Organizations). Then they will
automatically have access to all repositories created under the
Organization. You can choose the security settings.</p>

<div id="so-ive-made-some-changes-but-dont-really-want-to-keep-them-git-stash" class="section level3" number="4.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> So I’ve made some changes but don’t really want to keep them – git stash</h3>
<p>If you’ve changed some code but <em>have not committed it</em>, and then maybe got in a
mess and just want to go back to your last commit, you can <em>stash</em> your changes</p>
<pre><code>git stash</code></pre>
<p>and to include a message (for your future self):</p>
<pre><code>git stash save &quot;Message&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This stashes them away such that they can be retrieved later
This is handy. You may <em>think</em> you don’t want to keep those changes, but
sometimes you may later wish you had kept them somehwere.
Note this only for files that Git is tracking (i.e. files that have been added
at some point).</p>
<p>You can have multiple stashes, seen by doing:</p>
<pre><code>git stash list</code></pre>
<p>To retrieve the last stash:</p>
<p><code>git stash pop</code></p>
<p>TODO: check rules for other stashed things.</p>
<p>TODO: Often you’re working on something but it’s not finished, but you want to
push it. Stash, then make branch then copy files in. Tricky to do all with git,
so do manually.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.4</span> The power to go back</h3>
<p>With Git you can revert back to any previous state of your repository.
This is <span style="color: red;">very powerful</span>, though slightly
<span style="color: red;">scary</span> at first.</p>
<p>Do this with your test repository, that should have some files in it from the
earlier excercise:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git s</code> to make sure you are all up-to-date
(<code>commit</code> and/or <code>push</code> if necessary).</li>
<li>In File Explorer (or whatever you use) look at your repository, you should see
all your files, including the <code>new-stuff\</code> directory.</li>
<li>Look at the commit tab on GitHub for your test repo and click on the clipboard
icon to copy the HASH number thingy to the clipboard .</li>
<li>In Git shell: <code>git checkout HASH</code> (where <code>HASH</code> is the pasted HASH, or <code>git co   HASH</code> using our Alias)</li>
<li>Look at File Explorer again – your <code>new-stuff</code> directory should
have … disappeared!!</li>
<li>(If it hasn’t disappeared then open it – the test files, i.e. <code>test1.r</code>,
<code>test2.r</code>, etc. should be gone, but your text editor may
have saved backup versions; manually delete them plus the
<code>new-stuff/</code> directory.)</li>
<li>You are now back to the very first version of your repo!</li>
</ul>
<p>Powerful and scary.</p>
<p>Now, to get your files back to the most recent version you had committed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git checkout main</code> (it used to be <code>git checkout master</code>, the names have recently changed).</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! Check that your files are back. All this means that you can
<span style="color: red;">revert to any previous commit in your repository</span>.</p>
<p>This is very reassuring. For example you have some complex code that you realise
is now a complete mess and you want to go back to yesterday’s version of everything.</p>
<p>In practice you rarely actually do this, but it’s very comforting to know
that you can.</p>
<p>Consequently, your workflow is less cluttered and more tractable than having
to save multiple versions of the same files with dates in the filename, such
as this nightmare:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/EAversions.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p><strong>Retrieving older work in practice</strong></p>
<p>I think there are fancy ways that Git can replace a current file with a version
from an earlier commit. But, in practice (especially since you rarely want to do
this) it is a bit safer to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say you are up-to-date (<code>git s</code> says all is good), but your program
<code>my_code.R</code> just isn’t working and you want to go back to the version you had
yesterday at commit number <code>abc123</code>.</li>
<li><code>git co abc123</code> (or <code>git checkout abc123</code>) to checkout the earlier commit,
which includes the old version of <code>my_code.R</code> that you want get.</li>
<li>Copy <code>my_code.R</code> to a new file <code>my_code_old.R</code>. In the shell you can just do
this with <code>cp my_code.R my_code_old.R</code>.</li>
<li>Do NOT edit <code>my_code.R</code> or make any changes, as you may end up with a scary
<code>DETACHED HEAD</code> warning.</li>
<li><code>git co main</code> to checkout the latest version again.</li>
<li>Since you have NOT done <code>git add my_code_old.R</code>, Git is not tracking
<code>my_code_old.R</code> and so it is just sitting in your folder as normal.</li>
<li>Now you can manually copy what you want from <code>my_code_old.R</code> into <code>my_code.R</code>
to fix your problem. It could be the full file, or just some part of it.</li>
<li>Then commit as normal.</li>
<li>At some point you can delete <code>my_code_old.R</code> so it is not hanging around, but
you don’t have to. (Though maybe make a note in it as to which commit it was
from, in case you do need it again).</li>
</ul>

<div id="so-how-does-git-do-all-this" class="section level3" number="4.4.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> So how does Git do all this?</h3>
<p>By now you’re probably wondering how Git keeps track of everything.
Git does not keep versions of code, it keeps <em>commits</em>. The commits
are kept track of using a HASH key which is a generated 40-digit key in
hexadecimal (base 16). The hashes are
what you see on GitHub and in various places when you use Git shell.</p>
<p>By stitching all the commits back together again, Git can recreate all your code.</p>
<p>There is a hidden <code>.git/</code> directory in each repository.
Look at the <code>.git/objects/</code> subdirectory. Each subdirectory name is the
first two digits of a HASH. The rest of the digits of the HASH are the filenames in the
subdirectory.</p>
<p>You can basically think of the hashes as representing <code>commits</code> (apparently they can also
be <code>blobs</code> and <code>trees</code>, whatever they might be).
I think of the files in the subdirectories containing the <span style="color: red;">differences</span> between each commit.</p>
<p>Because of these structures, Git can go back and <span style="color: red;">rebuild</span> any or
all files at any <code>commit</code>, and even have different directory
structures at each commit.</p>
<p>Since Git is keeping track of differences between files, this all works best for
plain ASCii (text) files, such as <code>.R</code>, <code>.txt</code>, <code>.Rmd</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Git does work for binary files, such as <code>.xls</code>, <code>.docx</code>, <code>.RData</code>, but since
changes to the files are not easily saved (Git essentially has to resave
the whole file at each commit), this is not very efficient and may make
your repository large. Such files will be fully resaved every time they
are changed. Think of a binary file as something that you cannot open in a
text editor and read (it does not contain simple ASCii letters and numbers).</p>
<p>Exceptions: often you may have an image or photo or other type file that you need to share for a
document, but it isn’t going to keep changing. So that’s fine to commit.</p>
<p>An example of why you should not commit binary files:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collaborator was running some R code (and correctly committed the <code>.R</code> files
so that I could run it), but also committed the results, which included
<code>.pdf</code>, <code>.png</code> and <code>.RData</code> files, which can get quite large.</li>
<li>But, these latter files got updated every time the code was run. So changing
one line of the <code>.R</code> code (which Git deals with very efficiently), and running
that code and committing, resulted in the new <code>.pdf</code> etc. files being fully
saved (since Git cannot just save the difference from the last commit because
they are binary files). Even
if, say, one point changes on a figure in a graph in a <code>.pdf</code> file, Git has to
save the whole new version.</li>
<li>This ended up with <code>.git/objects/pack</code> (whatever that might be!) being 2.8Gb.</li>
<li>I needed space quickly on my computer so just deleted four files in
<code>.git/objects/pack</code>, which freed up 1.6Gb.</li>
<li>Note that I still had the actual final versions of files (as you would
if not using Git), but just not the full repository history.</li>
<li>However, when I tried to later do some work and then <code>commit</code> I got lots of
‘fatal’ errors with scary messages like <code>bad object HEAD</code> and the awesomely titled <code>You are on a branch yet to be born</code>:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/notGood.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>I just had to start again from scratch (reclone I think). Take-home message:</p>
<p><strong>Don’t mess with the .git directory!!</strong></p>

<div id="git-terminology" class="section level3" number="4.4.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.6</span> Git terminology</h3>
<p>At some point you will likely need to search online for some help (often
questions are posted and answered on the excellent ‘stackoverflow’ website).
A bit more understanding of terminology will help you.</p>
<p>Remember that Git keeps <em>commits</em>.
Several of these commits have pointers to them that have special names:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEAD</strong> points to the commit you are currently on in the Git shell.</li>
<li><strong>main</strong> or <strong>master</strong> is the default branch when you set up a repository on
GitHub (there are two names because of recent changes on GitHub).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="branching" class="section level3" number="4.4.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7</span> Branching</h3>
<p>So far we have only worked on the <strong>main</strong> branch. Sometimes you want to create
a new branch that branches off from the <strong>main</strong> branch. It’s bit like a tree
branching, except that at some point you want your new branch to be merged back
into <strong>main</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, you may want to try adding some new code to your project, but don’t
want to break what is already there. You may do this even if working alone, but
it’s especially useful if you are collaborating, or if, say, you have an R
packages hosted on GitHub that anyone may be downloading – you don’t want to
annoy them by pushing experimental code that doesn’t work.</p>
<p>So you would create a new branch, work on that new branch (i.e. commit
changes to the new branch), and when you are happy with your new changes you can
easily merge it all back into <strong>main</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Working on a new branch</strong></p>
<p>When creating a new branch, your starting point is identical to the branch you
were when you created the new one.</p>
<p>In the Git shell navigate into your test repository:</p>
<p><code>cd test</code></p>
<p>Depending on your set up, you should see <code>main</code> indicated somewhere (if not do
<code>git s</code> and it should say <code>On branch main</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure you are up-to-date and have committed all changes (<code>git s</code>, and
<code>commit</code> if necessary).</p>
<p>Create a new branch called <em>temp</em>, this will be based off the latest commit of the <em>main</em>
branch you are currently on:</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b temp</code></p>
<p>(We have an alias for that: <code></code>git cb temp`).</p>
<p>You will be automatically placed in the new branch called <em>temp</em>, and commits
you make will now occur in that branch only.</p>
<p>Make and <code>commit</code> some changes (e.g. add a new file) – these will now be on
your <em>temp</em> branch.</p>
<p>You can push to GitHub. The first time you try <code>git p</code>, the Git shell will
tell you that you need to type the following so that future pushes go to the
new branch:</p>
<p><code>git --set-upstream origin BRANCH-NAME</code></p>
<p>Check the GitHub webpage to see that your branch was pushed. You repository
page (that will still be looking at your <em>main</em> branch) may tell you that
there is a <em>temp</em> branch with more recent commits than <em>main</em>. If not then if
you click on the <em>main</em> drop-down menu:</p>
<p><img src="../module-1-git/images/main-branch.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>it should give you the option to look at your new <em>temp</em> branch. (The ‘1 branch’
in the above image should also say ‘2 branches’).</p>
<p>You can now view your new file in your new <em>temp</em> branch on GitHub.</p>
<p>A graphical way to see and understand branching is to click on
Insights–Network to see the Network graph.</p>
<p>The Network Graph is a useful visualization tool, where each commit is shown as
a point on the graph (the numbers along the top are the dates). You can hover
your mouse over a commit to see who committed it and the commit message. You can
click to see full details of the commit. The Network Graph is particularly
useful if you or others are working on multiple branches, or to check details
about merges.</p>
<p>Okay, back in your Git shell you can easily switch back to your original <em>main</em>
branch:</p>
<p><code>git checkout main</code> (or the alias <code>git co main</code>).</p>
<p>You will see that the file you just added is gone, because it
<span style="color: red;">only exists in the <em>temp</em> branch</span>
at this moment.</p>
<p>Imagine that in your <em>temp</em> branch you did several commits to create a new
function in your code, or have added some new text to a report. Now you are
happy with what you’ve done you want to merge it back into the <em>main</em> branch.</p>
<p>To view all local branches:</p>
<p><code>git branch</code></p>
<p>There is an asterisk next to the branch you are currently in.</p>
<p>To switch to another branch (<em>main</em> in our case):</p>
<p><code>git checkout main</code></p>
<p>To combine the changes from the <em>temp</em> branch:</p>
<p><code>git rebase temp</code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>git merge temp</code></p>
<p>Now the file you created in the <em>temp</em> branch now appears in the <em>main</em>
branch. All commits done in the <em>temp</em> branch will now be in the <em>main</em> branch
as well.</p>
<p>If there was a merge conflict, you must fix it at this point (see earleir).</p>
<p>Once you’ve merged your <em>temp</em> branch into <em>main</em>, you don’t really need <em>temp</em>
any more and so it is good protocol to delete to keep things tidy:</p>
<p><code>git branch -d temp</code></p>
<p>If you have unmerged changes in a branch, you will not be allowed to delete it,
but Git shell will tell you the command to forcibly delete it:</p>
<p><code>git branch -D temp</code></p>
<p>Warning – you won’t be able to get any of those changes back once you do this.</p>
<p>To remove a branch entirely from GitHub:</p>
<p><code>git p origin --delete BRANCH-NAME</code></p>
</div>
<div id="undoing-stuff" class="section level3" number="4.4.8">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.8</span> Undoing stuff</h3>
<p>If you make a commit followed by other commits, then realize you want to undo the earlier commit, you use <em>revert</em>:</p>
<p><code>git revert HASH</code></p>
<p>where <code>HASH</code> is the hash for the commit you want to undo. Remember that Git shell is smart enough that you only need the first five digits:</p>
<p><code>git revert 1ef1d</code></p>
<p>This actually creates a new commit with the automatic message</p>
<p><code>Revert "&lt;previous commit message&gt;"</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously, you have to be careful with this if you’re changing something that
was a few commits back, as you might mess up your code.</p>
<p><strong>Undoing changes not yet committed</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve made a mess in your working directory and you want to change
everything back to the way it was on the last commit:</p>
<p><code>git reset --hard HEAD</code></p>
<p>If you’ve messed up a single file and just want that one file to go back to the way it was on the last commit:</p>
<p><code>git checkout HEAD &lt;filename_to_restore&gt;</code></p>
<p>Warning – running these commands will delete the changes you have made. Since
you have not committed any changes, they will be lost. Make sure you are certain
you don’t need the changes before running these commands. If you aren’t sure if
you need the changes again in the future, use <code>git stash</code> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Changing the commit message in the last commit</strong></p>
<p>If you make a commit then realize you want to change it (add more information,
fix something that will confuse your colleagues, fix something that will confuse
you tomorrow), you can change the commit message:</p>
<p><code>git commit --amend -m "Correct message."</code></p>
<p>This only works on the last commit.</p>
<p>If you already pushed the commit before realizing that the message needs modification, do this:</p>
<p><code>git p --force</code></p>
<p>after making the amendment to the commit message.</p>
